## Introduction

JumpHead is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a character and blocks that act as obstacles. Your goal is to control the character and jump over the blocks to avoid collisions. The game keeps track of your score, and the challenge increases as you progress.

## Game Controls

To control the character in JumpHead, you only need one action:

- **Jump**: click anywhere on the screen to make the character jump.

Remember to time your jumps carefully to avoid hitting the blocks!

## Scoring

Your score in JumpHead is calculated based on the number of successful jumps you make over the blocks. The score is displayed in real-time on the game screen. Aim for a high score and challenge your friends to beat it!

## Game Over

The game ends when the character collides with a block. When this happens, a pop-up message will appear, displaying your total score for that game. Don't worry; you can always try again to improve your score!

## Installation
